            <p>The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə ˈliːsə/ MOH-nə LEE-sə; Italian: Gioconda [dʒoˈkonda] or Monna Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]; 
                French: Joconde [ʒɔkɔ̃d]) is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,[4][5]
                 it has been described as "the best known, the most visited,
                 the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".[6] The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,[7] 
                 the monumentality of the composition,
                the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.[8]
